### Project README: Exploratory Data Analysis on Online Retail Dataset

#### Overview:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, outliers, and correlations in an online retail dataset.
- Aimed to optimize store operations and enhance customer satisfaction through data-driven decisions.

#### Key Steps and Findings:
1. Data Loading and Overview:
   - Loaded dataset into Pandas DataFrame and displayed initial data rows.
   
2. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing values and removed redundant columns for streamlined analysis.
   
3. Statistical Analysis:
   - Calculated measures of central tendency and dispersion to understand dataset characteristics.
   
4. Data Visualization:
   - Utilized Matplotlib to create histograms and bar plots for visual insights.
